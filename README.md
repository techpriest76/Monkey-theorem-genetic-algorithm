# Monkey-theorem-genetic-algorithm
This genetic algorithm works as a proof of concept, it tries to replicate a given phrase, that can be changed by editing the code, using and biology-inspired approach.
It generates a populaton of random characters and then selects some of them to reproduce by an analog process to genetic crossover and introduces some variaton by random mutation to create a new generation, is process is repeated until the desired phrase is reached or a maximum of 200 generations is reached.
